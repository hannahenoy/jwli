                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>The Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three visionary women in Boston, Massachusetts:
                    Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women leaders, referred to as the Fellows,
                    from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of hands on experience and training with successful nonprofit organizations in
                    nonprofit management and leadership development. During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an Action Plan,
                    which will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their dreams of social change a reality. After returning to Japan, the
                    Fellows are expected to make a difference in their communities based on their Action Plans. The purpose of this program is 
                    for the fellows to share the knowledge and experience they acquired in Boston with other women and social dector leaders within Japan.
                    <br><br>
                    The Fish Family Founation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based nonprofit organizations, is administering JWLI in
                    partnership with Simmons College School of Management's Center for Gender in Organizations.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2010, thanks to generous funding provided by the U.S-Japan Foundation, JWLI expanded its vision to hold public forums within
                    Japan. Held in 2010, 2012, and 2013, these public forums provided information about the nonprofit sector and the American approach
                    to philanthropy with hopes to inspire women to take leadership roles. The Forum Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens,
                    advocating for their involvement in addressing the needs of Japanese society.

                    Relief Fund-Boston (JDRFB) with The Boston Foundation (TBF) and the Japan Society Boston (JSB) to support immediate and mid-term recovery
                    in the affected regions of Tohoku. Atsuko visited Tohoku several times after the disaster to assessed and evaluated the needs of the people
                    and community. In the two years the fund was active for, JDRFB raised approximately $1 million and distributed 24 grants to 19 organizations
                    and projects working directly in Tohoku. It has been reported by the grantees that JDRFB's $1 million grants were leveraged to have $6
                    million of economic impact.
