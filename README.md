<b>Goals:</b>
This was one of my first projects focusing on CSS and jQuery. I wanted to perfect the positioning and make sure everything looked good across all screen devices. Before starting this project I had very little knowledge about absolute positioning and creating media queries.

<b>Results:</b>
By the end of completing this project, I learned how to make my website fully responsive across all screen sizes and made sound content/design decisions.
